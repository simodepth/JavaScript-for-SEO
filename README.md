# JavaScript-for-SEO
Here is a repository of JavaScript snippets that you can use to automate plenty of daily SEO workload.

For example, The <b>Word Count and Text Extraction</b> is by far one of my favourite a it allows you to extract the <i>body</i> from a webpage and count the number of words excluding the <i>header</i> and the <i>footer</i>. 
## N.B : this works well without JavaScript post-rendering injections.
